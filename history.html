    <h1 class="entry-title">History</h1>
    
    <p>Originally sources from <a href="https://lintendijkenpaden.zaanstad.nl/over-de-zaanse-linten-dijken-paden/koog-aan-de-zaan">Zaanstad Council</a></p>
<p>Koog aan de Zaan probably originated in the 16th century near the Kogerhem, where there was also a lock. An inn (now De Waakbaarheid) was built next to that lock in the 17th century. South of the Kogerhem, a church was built in the 17th century, around which a small neighborhood grew up. Koog aan de Zaan was long connected to Zaandijk by sharing a school, church, cemetery and poor and orphan care.
Church neighborhood</p>
<p>In 1543 there were about 30 inhabitants. At the end of the 16th century this number increased. They were probably engaged in inland fishing, inland navigation and the reception of travelers. The village got a small center because a church neighborhood developed around the church.</p>
<h1>High demand for groats</h1>
<p>In the 17th century, mills were built in this village, in the Kogerhem but also in the fields. This includes peeling mills, paper mills and groats peelers. Barley porridge was popular food and provisions for the ships and there was a great demand for barley.</p>
<h1>Double neighborhood</h1>
<p>In the 17th century, the paths were built perpendicular to the dike. It is striking that especially the paths near the locks north and south of the village were built on. The double neighborhood also emerged, just south of the Kogerhem, due to the impending breach of the dike. The road ditch was filled in to strengthen the dike and placed further inland. This created the double neighborhood, a unique structure of two dikes next to each other.</p>
<h1>Factories in Koog</h1>
<p>Koog was doing well economically in the 18th century. This was due to the starch factories, inland fishing, oil mills, peeling mills and paint mills. The mills on the Kogerhem were replaced by factories and factories were also established in the south. The factories of the Honig family in the north and south of the village are characteristic of Koog aan de Zaan. Here too, some villa buildings were added to the ribbon at this time. Yet this village mainly had small-scale buildings. At the beginning of the 19th century, population growth slowed, much later than in other Zaanse villages.</p>
<h1>Comb structure</h1>
<p>Koog aan de Zaan had a comb structure until the end of the 19th century. There were richer buildings on the side of the Zaan and smaller-scale workers' homes on the side of the land of the dike. This changed at the end of the 19th century when the road ditch was filled in and buildings were demolished to build factories. The wealthy owners of the factories had villas and offices built on both sides of the dike.</p>
<h1>Highway crossed ribbon</h1>
<p>At the beginning of the 20th century, the village was expanded with new working-class neighborhoods, especially south of Kogerhem. The old structure of the paths was built around, so that the ridge structure remained. The construction of the A8 motorway in the 20th century caused the structure of the long dike to be crossed.</p>
